Come tomorrow way down south In St. Amore 
oh oh oh
Reunited with my love In St. Amore 
oh oh oh
 
Jezahel jezahel
Jezahel jezahel
 
Will we both go home so we can be together 
oh oh oh
Really both go home to stay in love forever 
oh oh oh
 
Jezahel jezahel
Jezahel jezahel
 
Scorching sun upon a beach near a cantina 
Out of reach where there's no one to come between us 
oh oh oh
 
Jezahel jezahel
Jezahel jezahel
 
Yes I scan your eyes I scan your eyes I see desire
oh oh oh
Wind and rain can't stop the flame that starts the fire 
oh oh oh
 
Jezahel jezahel
Jezahel jezahel
Jezahel jezahel
